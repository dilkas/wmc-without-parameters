ADDMC: exact Model Counter using Algebraic Decision Diagrams
Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   ./data/Grid/Cnf2/Ratio_75/75-10-4-q.cnf
* declaredVarCount              100
* apparentVarCount              100
* declaredClauseCount           1
* apparentClauseCount           1

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  CONDITIONAL
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0

Counting models...
* modelCount                    0.577558
* seconds                       0.282
