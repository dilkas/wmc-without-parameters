ADDMC: exact Model Counter using Algebraic Decision Diagrams
Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   data/DQMR/qmr-100/or-100-20-10.dne.cnf
* declaredVarCount              600
* apparentVarCount              600
* declaredClauseCount           1100
* apparentClauseCount           1101

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  MINIC2D
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0
