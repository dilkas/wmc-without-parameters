Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   data/DQMR/qmr-60/or-60-20-4-10.inst.dne.cnf
* declaredVarCount              357
* apparentVarCount              357
* declaredClauseCount           625
* apparentClauseCount           625

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  MINIC2D
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0
