ADDMC: exact Model Counter using Algebraic Decision Diagrams
Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   ./data/Grid/Cnf/Ratio_50/50-12-5-q.cnf
* declaredVarCount              672
* apparentVarCount              444
* declaredClauseCount           1056
* apparentClauseCount           829

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  CACHET
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0

Counting models...
