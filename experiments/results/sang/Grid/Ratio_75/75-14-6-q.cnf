ADDMC: exact Model Counter using Algebraic Decision Diagrams
Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   ./data/Grid/Cnf/Ratio_75/75-14-6-q.cnf
* declaredVarCount              924
* apparentVarCount              394
* declaredClauseCount           1456
* apparentClauseCount           927

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  CACHET
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0

Counting models...
* modelCount                    0.345549
* seconds                       4.58
