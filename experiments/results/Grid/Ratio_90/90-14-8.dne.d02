Version v1.0.0, released on 2020/02/02

Reading DIMACS CNF file:
* cnfFilePath                   data/Grid/Ratio_90/90-14-8.dne.cnf
* declaredVarCount              362
* apparentVarCount              362
* declaredClauseCount           1302
* apparentClauseCount           1303

Constructing model counter:
* weightFormat                  MINIC2D
* clustering                    BOUQUET_TREE
* clusterVarOrder               LEXP
* inverseClusterVarOrder        0
* diagramVarOrder               MCS
* inverseDiagramVarOrder        0
